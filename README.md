# Ontology Website for Non-Alcoholic Beverages

## Project Target

>Propose an ontological model – possibly, by reusing (parts of) existing ontologies – regarding the most common non-alcoholic beverages. Also, create the knowledge graph including the (groups of) users' preferences about a certain set of beverages like coffee, tea, milk, juice, soft drink, mocktail, plus their usages based on context – for example, a festive event, age, health restrictions (diabetes, lactose intolerance), location, season. Additionally, specify useful (meta-)data: category, price, ingredients, images, perishability, availability, offers, reviews, recipes, etc. Starting with this conceptual specification, a Web application will be developed in order to manage the collected knowledge and providing "smart" browsing and filtering, plus suggestions and correlations. Explore also BEVON: [Beverage Ontology](http://rdfs.co/bevon/), [FoodOn](https://foodon.org/), [Beverages @ Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/beverages), and [Product concept @ Schema.org](https://schema.org/Product).
